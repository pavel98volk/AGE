\chapter{The Comparative Table of Multi-Agent Frameworks, Platforms and Simulation Toolkits}
\label{appendix:frameworks}
The choice of properties for this table was highly influenced by \cite{ap4}. The broad set of available agent-based frameworks was taken from \cite{ap1, ap2,ap3, ap5}. Also \cite{JAVAap} and \cite{wikiSoft} were taken into account. \newline
