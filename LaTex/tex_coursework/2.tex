\chapter{Multi-Agent Systems}
One way to sustain the simulation is to create a simulation process that will feature constant communication with a user of the simulation system.
Describing game characters in terms of their beliefs, intentions and desires is a common way for humans to understand the world and, therefore, a comfortable way to recreate it in a computer simulation. Using agent notion it is possible to create a simulation environment, that would be easily understandable by a human being as well as use existing frameworks to reduce the amount of code, required to make an operable framework and create tests. This chapter provides information on how it can be achieved.\par
