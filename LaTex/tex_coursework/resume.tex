\chapter*{Conclusions}
This work captured an attempt to partially automate storyline designer role in game development by designing the corresponding framework. Different challenges that might occur during the framework implementation (such as resource distribution) were analyzed and for some of them possible solutions were proposed in \textit{Model1} specification. The applicability of the created framework architecture was shown on the particular game.

Now, when the architecture is already specified it is possible to create an implementation of the framework, therefore might be done by the author during the next academic year.
